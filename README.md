I followed the tutorial created by Kevin Powell hosted on freecodecamp's Youtube channel. Here is the link to it: https://youtu.be/_xkSvufmjEs

What I Learned:

-Subtle effects like underlining a link when you hover over it, changing color of a picture link when you hover over it
-Using inspect in browser to know whether you should change margin, padding, border for desired effect
-How to use javascript to make the common sliding menu (adding and removing classes)
  -A class doesn't have to be in the html document for you to use it
-Em, rem units
-How to organize elements with specific class names
-Box shadow tricks
-Mix-blend-mode

What I would like to work on:
-How to use javscript to manipulate DOM. need more practice with that
-Adding parallax thing (wasn't covered in tutorial)
-Github (I still don't really understand it)
-Having more pictures of myself
-Being cooler
